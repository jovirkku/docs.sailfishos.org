There may be a need to follow what is happening in a Sailfish OS device. At least, it is nice to have a deeper look into the system out of curiosity.

There are several apps for showing different aspects of a Sailfish device. However, the author's absolute favourite is the app by the name **System Monitor (Fork)** from Open Repos distribution.

Another lightweight system monitor is **Lighthouse**. With app **Battery Buddy** one can try to improve the lifetime of the battery (it does not have any other typical features of a system monitor).

The following chapters show how to install the discussed apps.
